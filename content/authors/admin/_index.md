I'm co-founder of [CodeShield](https://codeshield.io). Prior to that, I worked as a research associate in the [Secure Software Engineering Group](https://www.hni.uni-paderborn.de/en/sse/)  advised by [Prof. Dr. Eric Bodden](https://www.bodden.de/) and [Prof. Dr. Ben Hermann](https://benhermann.eu/) at Paderborn University starting in 2017. 
I received the MSc In Computer Science from Paderborn University in 2016. 

My research interests include program analysis with a security focus, empirical software engineering, and the detection of vulnerabilities in open-source software. 
I'm an advocate of open-source software and an AWS community builder. I'm also one of the main contributors of the static analysis framework [Soot](https://github.com/soot-oss/soot).
