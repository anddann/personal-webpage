I'm currently doing my Ph.D. as an external research associate in the [Secure Software Engineering Group](https://www.hni.uni-paderborn.de/en/sse/) advised by [Prof. Dr. Eric Bodden](https://www.bodden.de/) and [Prof. Dr. Ben Hermann](https://benhermann.eu/) at Paderborn. 
I received an MSc in Computer Science from Paderborn University in 2016. 

My research comprises the detection of vulnerable open-source libraries, evaluating their usage, and providing automated approaches for updating by applying static code analysis and empirical software engineering methods.


Before that, I've been Co-Founder at [CodeShield GmbH](https://codeshield.io) and an AWS community builder. 

<!-- I'm also one of the main contributors of the static analysis framework [Soot](https://github.com/soot-oss/soot). -->
