abstract: Future cyber-physical systems will behave smart, i.e., they will provide
  self-* properties and collaborate with each other. Software realizes this smart
  behavior. In modern cars, a hardware platform consists of up to 100 networked electronic
  control units (ECUs) that execute the software. As the amount of safety-critical
  software increases, the task of describing a suitable hardware platform for deploying
  safety-critical software components to ECUs becomes more complicated. Existing approaches
  for the definition of a hardware platform do not address the different stakeholder's
  concerns and do not provide a systematic method. This leads to an error-prone development.
  In this paper, we identify viewpoints for the stakeholder's concerns and provide
  a method for the multi-view modeling of hardware platforms. In addition, we support
  hierarchical and variable horizontal composition of hardware platforms by transferring
  concepts from component-based software engineering. To test our method, we use an
  Arduino-based cooperative adaptive cruise control system.
